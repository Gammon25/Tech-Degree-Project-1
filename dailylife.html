              <h2>Our New Home</h2>
              <p>Myself and Hollie, my fiancee bought our first house back in December! Its a new build so was under construction and we were due to move in this month, but due to the global pandemic of Coronavirus it has been delayed until January 2021!</p>
              <p>Its been an agonising wait, especially as its in a different county so we are leaving the place we have grown up in for the last 27 years!</p>
